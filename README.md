#tufteskine
Pelican Theme based on [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css).

## Usage
- Each page is an article. The index uses a section tag to logically group up articles. 
- Use section tags in general around each logical grouping of text and headings. 
- Using New Thought:  For this we use a span with the class newthought.


## Evolution
- Changed the font pixel size. Things look shit now. Very different from the page [here](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) 
- Tufte uses four levels of headings for his setup. If I use two levels for my blog title and subtitle, it kind of fucks up the rest of the blog. I attempted removing the header from the blog, it looks weird and empty. Could be that I need to do more work on this or perhaps use a different font style for this. It may very well be that you'd have to suck it up and use the different font style for blog title/subtitle.
